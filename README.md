# SparseInst_TensorRT
 This repository implement the real-time Instance Segmentation Algorithm named SparseInst with TensoRT and ONNX.
 
The initial repository has been clone from hustvl/SparseInst (https://github.com/hustvl/SparseInst.git), for additional information about the installation of SparseInst, refer to the original repository. This project is built upon the excellent framework detectron2, and you should install detectron2 first, please check official installation guide for more details.
